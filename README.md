# Text Smmerization 
Text summarization is the process of creating a shorter version of a longer text while retaining its most important information. It involves identifying the key points, ideas, and concepts within a text and then condensing them into a more concise form, while still retaining the essence of the original content.

There are two main types of text summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization involves selecting important sentences or phrases from the original text and combining them to form a summary. Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, involves generating new sentences that capture the meaning of the original text but may not be present in the original content.

Text summarization has many applications, including news article summaries, email triage, and automatic document summarization. It can save time and increase efficiency by allowing readers to quickly grasp the main points of a document without having to read through the entire text.
